                        <p class="paragraph">Locals were left speechless when the number one suspect of a recent string of murders was found dead at the crime scene today at electrical. The witness, who reported the body in electrical claims that he had only been passing through to fix the lights, when he found Red’s body. “Man, it was wild, first thing, the lights go out, then there’s a dead body. It had to have been Green, he was following Red everywhere.”

                        <br><br>We got a chance to speak with the locals, on their opinion of the matter. Their names were changed to protect their identity, and assigned colours as a label. Brown said that he had seen Red and Green head into the storage area, but had no idea things would’ve escalated the way they did. Blue claims that he saw Red head into electrical, but he did not see Green. Blue also claimed that shortly after Red headed into electrical, he saw the lights dimming, and White running into electrical full speed. “It’s extremely possible that White didn’t see me,” Blue added. “I don’t want to throw any undue suspicion but if you ask me, White kinda sus.”

                        <br><br>After a long session of deliberating, the residents voted who they thought was the suspect, and White was thrown out the airlock.

                        <p class="paragraph">Kemar Williams, ex-student of the University of The West Indies, drops out of university in order to catch up on his sleep. We were able to get through to Kemar for an exclusive interview.

                        <br><br>“I went to classes everyday, but they were extremely draining. The math was long, hard and frankly felt unnecessary, the different courses I had to do were just troublesome overall, and I was not getting enough sleep. I was not about to let it affect my mental health.” Kemar said, when asked why he made the decision.

                        <br><br>Kemar’s friends have expressed that they were entirely jealous of him, and look up to him. It’s only a matter of time before our young students decide that this was the move for the future.
